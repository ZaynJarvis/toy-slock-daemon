# Daemon

## Overview

This is the daemon component of the platform. It runs on a machine, connects to the server via WebSocket, and manages AI agent processes (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Kimi CLI).

## Architecture

```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Two-layer architecture**: `index.ts` (WebSocket daemon) spawns agent processes that get `chat-bridge.ts` (MCP server) injected as their tool provider. These are separate processes.
- **Pull-based message delivery**: Busy agents receive stdin notifications ("You have N new messages"), not full message content. They pull via `check_messages` at their own cadence.
- **Idle cache**: When an agent's turn ends (exit 0), its config and session ID are cached. New messages auto-restart it with the cached session.
- **Driver abstraction**: Each runtime (claude/codex/kimi) implements the `Driver` interface for spawn args, output parsing, and stdin encoding.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # tsup — builds dist/index.js + dist/chat-bridge.js
npm run dev            # tsx watch mode
npm test               # node --test
```

## Commit Conventions

- `fix:` for bug fixes, `feat:` for new features, `refactor:` for structural changes
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
- Run `npm run build` before pushing

## Important Notes

- `chat-bridge.ts` filename must not change — tsup entry point config and runtime path resolution depend on it
- Protocol message types must match the server's expected protocol exactly
- The `ready` message capabilities array must only contain: `agent:start`, `agent:stop`, `agent:deliver`, `workspace:files`
- Agent workspace data lives in `~/.slock/agents/{agentId}/`
